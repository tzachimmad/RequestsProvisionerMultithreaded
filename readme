MultiThreaded cpp application for parsing requests for potential vulnerabilities.
4 worker threads, within RequestProvisioner class. Worker threads are part of 
RequestProccessor class, which inherits from EventQueue which is an eventloop class.
Requests are read from a json file in chunks via JsonParser class within RequestProvisoner
class. Each request is assigned a worker class to handle it async in a different thread, 
affinity per thread is done via hashing username, so multiple insances of the same 
username will be handled by the same thread.
All prints to screen are done exclusively within RequestProvisioner class, the threads do not
print messages, they add them to a message queue that RequestProvisioner is in charge of poping.

Regards and Enjoy
